# Machine Learning Lab

A Repository that show my progress on Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence 
World.You can find here basic activities about Python like file manipulation, pratical
cource activity about the start of my knowledge in Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional
Neural Networks, Image Classification Models using Pytorch or TensorFlow (Datasets: Mnist,
Fashion Mnist, Horses or Humans and Lens) and for now, a breef knowledge about MLFlow and in
the near future some codes about NLP(Natural Language Processing).
